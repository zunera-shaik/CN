How to run Nmap scan
Requirements
● Nmap installed on Linux, Windows, or Mac
● Terminal/Command Prompt access
● Target IP (example: scanme.nmap.org or a local IP like 192.168.1.10)
Step-by-Step Lab Program
1. Basic Host Scan
This command discovers which devices are active on the subnet
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
● Lists live hosts within the subnet, skips port scan.
2. Simple Port Scan
Scan open ports on a target device.
nmap scanme.nmap.org
● Displays which common ports (top 1000) are open and corresponding services.
3. Stealth SYN Scan
Performs a half-open TCP SYN scan for stealthier port detection.
nmap -sS scanme.nmap.org
● Detects open, closed, and filtered TCP ports.
4. Service and Version Detection
Finds out which services are running and their versions.
nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org
● Advanced scan, useful for service enumeration.
5. OS Detection and Aggressive Scan
Performs a scan including OS fingerprinting and traceroute.
nmap -A scanme.nmap.org
● Detailed results: OS, services, open ports, tracerou

6. Scan Specific Ports
Scan only selected ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443).
nmap -p 22,80,443 scanme.nmap.org
● Saves time if searching for specific services
7. UDP Port Scan
Scans UDP services; slower but sometimes needed.
sudo nmap -sU scanme.nmap.org
● Run with sudo for privileged access.
Sample Output
After running a scan, Nmap lists:
● PORT | STATE | SERVICE
● 22/tcp | open | ssh
● 80/tcp | open | http
● 443/tcp | closed | https
